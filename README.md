## Web Application

The web application consists of a frontend written in Razor views, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The backend was written in C# using ASP.NET Core 2, Entity Framework Core, and the MVC framework.

The web application is an online golf store that sells different kinds of golf equipment from clubs, balls, to shoes, and clothing. The app allows a user to login as either an administrator or an editor and utilizes cookies to remember the user and their credentials.

The app also allows the administrator full access to the Admin page which allows them to create different categories within the E-Commerce site and also link products to those categories.

The admin has the authorization to upload images for each product as well so users can see an image of the different products that are being offered.
